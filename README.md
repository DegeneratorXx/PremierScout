# PremierZone

A Spring Boot application that provides a REST API to manage football players. This project serves as a demonstration of building a simple RESTful web service using the Spring Boot framework.

## Technologies Used

*   **Java**: Version 21
*   **Spring Boot**: Version 3.4.12
*   **Maven**: For project build and dependency management
*   **PostgreSQL**: As the relational database to store player data
*   **Spring Data JPA**: To interact with the database
*   **Spring Web**: For building the REST API
*   **Springdoc OpenAPI**: For generating API documentation (Swagger UI)

## Features

*   **GET Players**: Retrieve a list of all players or filter them by:
    *   Team and position
    *   Team
    *   Name
    *   Position
    *   Nation
*   **GET Players (Paginated)**: Retrieve players in pages.
*   **ADD Player**: Add a new player to the database.
*   **UPDATE Player**: Update an existing player's information.
*   **DELETE Player**: Remove a player from the database.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/premiere-zone.git
    cd premiere-zone
    ```

2.  **Configure the database:**
    Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and update the following properties to match your PostgreSQL database configuration:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your-database
    spring.datasource.username=your-username
    spring.datasource.password=your-password
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    You can run the application using the Maven wrapper included in the project:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    The application will start on the default port `8080`.

## API Endpoints

The base URL for the API is `/api/player`.

| `GET`    | `/?nation={nation}`                        | Get players by nation.                            |
| `GET`    | `/?team={team}&position={position}`        | Get players by team and position.                 |

| `DELETE` | `/{playerName}`                            | Delete a player by their name.                    |

## Global Exception Handling

This project implements centralized exception handling using Spring Boot’s `@ControllerAdvice` to ensure consistent and meaningful API error responses.

### Implemented Exceptions

- **PlayerNotFoundException:** 
  Thrown when a player is not found during update or delete ops.  
  HTTP Status: 404 Not Found

- **DuplicatePlayerException:** Thrown when attempting to add a player that already exists.  
  HTTP Status: 409 Conflict

### Error Response Structure

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "message": "Player not Found Lakshitttt",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-20T17:26:05.218"
}
```
### API Behavior Examples

| Endpoint | Scenario | HTTP Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| DELETE `/api/player/{name}` | Player does not exist | 404 Not Found |
| POST `/api/player` | Player already exists | 409 Conflict |
| PUT `/api/player` | Player not found | 404 Not Found |



## API Documentation

This project uses `springdoc-openapi` to automatically generate API documentation. Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at the following URL:

[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

The Swagger UI provides a user-friendly interface to explore and test the API endpoints.
